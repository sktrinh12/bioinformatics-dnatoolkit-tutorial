> ### Bioinformatics Toolkit

Python modules to run basic bioinformatic tasks such as sequence reads,
translatioin, transcription, reverse complement, nucleotide frequency count,
etc.

There are Rosalind challenges [link](http://rosalind.info/) that have been solved individually in their
respective directories. Most challenges use the `bio_seq` class.

In addition, there are Stepik Code Challenges [link](https://stepik.org/) in their own directory.

`main.py` is the main file to run for testing. Some code was adopted from
*rebelCoder* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/RebelCoder/dna-toolset).
