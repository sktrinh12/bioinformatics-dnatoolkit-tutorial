### Bioinformatics Toolkit

Python modules to run basic bioinformatic tasks such as sequence reads,
translatioin, transcription, reverse complement, nucleotide frequency count,
etc.

There are Rosalind challenges that have been solved individually in the
respective folder. Most challenges use the `bio_seq` class.

`main.py` is the main file to run for testing. Some code was adopted from
*rebelCoder* [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/RebelCoder/dna-toolset).
